## Required Reading

[Chris Guillebeau's 39 steps to launch PDF](http://100startup.com/resources/launch-checklist.pdf) and [Podcast Ep 1234](https://sidehustleschool.com/episode/1234/)

- Prelaunch
  - Studio start hyping their movies a year in advance - let them know whats in advance, whats the release date
  - Set a goal - if you have never launched before (get first customer? whats a good number?)
  - Build urgency - true reason for timeliness or scarcity going into the launch
  - Remember [6 factors of persuasion](https://sidehustleschool.com/classroom/#chatra): [authority, commitment and consistency, social proof](https://traffic.megaphone.fm/CAD2380931227.mp3), [liking, reciprocity, and scarcity](https://traffic.megaphone.fm/CAD3368058854.mp3).
  - Record a video or audio message to complement your written copy
  - Write copy in advance, proofread everything, **check it on mobile**
  - Test purchase your own product to make sure it works
  - Ask for help to spread the word. Your friends will help, but you have to ask.
- Launch day:
  - soft launch, make sure everything working
  - post on social networks youre already active in
  - use GA to monitor website traffic - write to first 3-5 buyers, make sure everything is OK
  - celebrate your win
- Postlaunch:
  - think about next launch, write down what you learned

[An eBook pricing model that resulted in $100,000 in sales](https://blog.asmartbear.com/selling-ebook.html) - How you price a product can have a radical impact on the revenue you make from it. My search for the perfect pricing model resulted in an additional $50,000 (a 170% increase) in revenue. Here’s how.

[Six figures in 26 hours](https://seanwes.com/podcast/199-behind-the-scenes-of-a-177803-hand-lettering-course-launch-that-made-six-figures-in-26-hours/) - Behind the Scenes of a $177,803 Hand Lettering Course Launch That Made the First Six Figures in 26 Hours

[Mariah Coz presentation](https://www.notion.so/egghead/Mariah-Coz-Launch-Schedule-f1eec2e83a274bbda7a0a7c4550c4c92)

[The $61,392 Book Launch That Let Me Quit My Job](https://adamwathan.me/the-book-launch-that-let-me-quit-my-job/) - Within the first three days it generated $61,392 in revenue and gave me the confidence to quit my day job and work on my own ideas full-time. (You cited Adam, so you probably already read this, but I didn't found any mention to the email templates, so, here it is just in case)

[Nailing Your First Launch - Adam Wathan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajrDxZRpP9M) - More details into the 'Refactoring to Collections' book launch

[How I Made $40,000 Off A Book…Before I Even Published It.](https://medium.com/@emmabostian/how-i-made-40-000-off-a-book-before-i-even-published-it-4125ac812a94) - Every product and marketing strategy is different and will yield different outcomes. Every product serves a different market need and some are more needed than others.

[How mispricing an eBook got me the wrong readers. What I learned.](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/how-mispricing-an-ebook-got-me-the-wrong-readers-what-i-learned-1db0310083) - I had to completely remove it from sales too, to fix my mistake. That's me.

## Advice

    - pick something that sells itself
    - solves a pain
    - evergreen - flexbox is done
  - 2 parts personality + reputation
  - 2 parts community
  - 2 parts good marketing
    - who is this for?
    - email is king - 4.2x twitter

    - TELL THEM its good

wesbos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBlOxBQrP9I

- Find people who run podcasts that will vouch for your product.
- make it good: "wes did an awesome job with this series etc"
- shoptalk show - sponsorship was good

## Endorsements

- give 4-8 weeks with a final week followup?
- https://www.amarketingexpert.com/step-by-step-guide-to-getting-celebrity-book-endorsements-forewords-and-early-reviews-for-your-book/
  - book cover
  - 1pg overview of book
  - early reviews/endorsements
  - table of contents
  - 3 chapter sample
  - prewritten forward/endorsements
- https://writersrelief.com/2015/02/25/get-book-cover-quote-endorsement-famous-author/
  - Introduce yourself in a personal way, then state that you’re asking for a book jacket quote.
  - Briefly offer the details about your book: genre, story, publisher, release date.
  - Explain why you think the author in question is a kindred spirit who might like your book. Possible reasons could be: you also like his/her writing; one of the author’s titles compares well with yours; or you both love and write about the same topics.
  - Give the author a deadline for the potential endorsement, but offer as big a timeline as possible. 
  - Let the author know where the blurb will be used. Will it be on your book cover, your author website, or both?
  - Don’t forget to say thank you!
- https://pithywordsmithery.com/2017/01/book-endorsement-quotes/
  - Email Subject: Will you endorse my book?
  - The introduction of the book and one or two of the best chapters, ideally put into one PDF that is marked confidential. (You should offer to send the whole manuscript, but don’t send it right away.  It could seem overwhelming to review a long document and be a turn off.)
  - A jpeg of the cover art, if you have it.
  - Step 1: Insert flattery while at the same time being genuine.  Bonus points if you can proactively help the person out somehow.
  - Step 2: Draw a connection between what they do and your book.
  - Step 3: Explain the project.
  - Step 4: Explain what you need and provide a deadline.

Dear THEIR NAME,

My name is YOUR NAME and I've recently finished a book that I think you would be interested. It's called TITLE and it's DESCRIPTION OF THE BOOK. I've attached a sample of the book here to give you a better sense of it.

NOW, IN 2-3 SENTENCES, CONNECT THE BOOK TO THEIR WORK OR LET THEM KNOW WHY YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THEM OR HOW THEY INSPIRED YOU.

I'd be honored if you would consider looking at the book, and if it resonates with you, providing me with an endorsement. If you'd like, I can send you a full digital or paperback version of the book, whichever you prefer.

PERSONALIZED CONCLUSION LINE THAT, AGAIN, CONNECTS YOUR WORK TO THEIRS.

Thanks for your time and consideration,

YOUR NAME
```

Hi <author name>,

I loved your book <title> and found it enlightening because . . . ​<briefly explain>

I have a new book coming out this winter: <title>. It’s about <brief description, just two or three sentences>. I am in the process of gathering endorsements for the jacket. Would you consider providing a testimonial? I would be happy to send you sample chapters or the entire manuscript for review—whatever you prefer. Having your support would mean a lot to me.

Thanks very much for your consideration.

Warm wishes,

<your name>

<your website link so he/she can see you’re a pro>
